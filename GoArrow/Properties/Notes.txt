	- The update URL now saves.
	- Dungeon HUD eats mouse clicks.
	- Workaround for bug in Decal where DefaultView.Activated could be 
		incorrectly set to true when the plugin was initialized.
	- Update house information after login complete if it's available.
	- The map should now center on the player when it's first opened and 
		"Center on player" is selected.
	
1.2.0.1
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused a NullReferenceException.
	- Fixed a bug where you occasionally had to click "Locate on map" twice 
		(from the Details tab) to actually have the map center on a location.
	- The arrow now properly saves the route or tagged person that it was 
		pointing to.

1.2.0.0
	Atlas/Route Finding
	- Route finding will no longer suggest routes that involve running through
		the ocean to an island.  Unfortunatley, it can still suggest routes that 
		involve running over impassable slopes or through deep lakes.
	- The coordinates for start locations now save properly when set while 
		dual-logging.
	- Removed the "Relative to me" part when you copy a location's information 
		from the details tab.
	- Reset the "Auto update recalls" option to default to on, since almost 
		everyone turned it off due to the bug from v1.1.0.1.
	- Added portal gems to the list of start locations, but they are disabled 
		by default. You can enable them on the Settings > Route Finding > 
		Start Locations tab if you use portal gems.
	- GoArrow will now automatically detect and use portal devices at your 
		mansion. Configure it on the Settings > Route Finding > Portal Devices tab.
	- If you haven't updated the locations database in over a month, GoArrow 
		will remind you to update it when you log in.
	
	All HUDs
	- Added a HUD Toolbar, similar to the Decal toolbar, that lets you easily 
		turn on and off the Arrow, Dereth Map, and Dungeon Map.
	- All HUDs (Arrow, Dereth Map, Dungeon Map) now share the same opacity 
		settings.
	- Added options for which mouse buttons control the Dereth and Dungeon maps.
	- Reduced graphics memory usage.
	
	Arrow HUD
	- The arrow now has an [X] box to close it with the mouse (only visible when
		the mouse is over the arrow and the CTRL key is held down).
	
	Dereth Map
	- Updated the map for Dark Isle.
	- Added a right-click menu for the map.
	- The arrow's destination is shown as an orange triangle on the map.
	- Panning the map while running no longer makes the map keep jumping back 
		to the player's location if "Center on player" is selected. The map 
		will recenter on the player when the mouse button is released.
	- The "Center on player" option recenters the map less frequently 
		(improves AC's framerate when you're running with the map open).
	- Fixed an error when mousing over a location that was on the edge of the map.
	
	Dungeon Map
	- The map should no longer get "stuck" zoomed all the way out.
		
	Chat Commands/DHS
	- The /goarrow dest command includes the name of the arrow's destination, 
		if it has one.
	- The /goarrow to, start, and end commands accept location names in addition 
		to coordinates, but the name must be an exact match (e.g., 
		"/goarrow to abandoned mines" will make the arrow point to Abandoned Mines)
	- Added /goarrow search command to search the location database from the 
		command line.
	- Added /goarrow find command that finds an object on the landscape by name
		(like BS/2's or ElTank's /find command).  You optionally make an alias
		to this command (such as /find).
	- Added a DHS hotkey to make the character face towards the arrow's destination.
	- Added a DHS hotkey and chat command (/goarrow tag) to let you "attach" the 
		arrow to a player, monster, or other object.  The arrow will continue 
		to point to the target even if it moves.

1.1.0.1
	- Made lines closer together in location descriptions.

1.1.0.0
	- Fixed initial run distance for start locations
	- Changed Favorites and Recent lists to work similarly to search and route 
		lists in terms of click handling
	- Added '/goarrow loc' command (same as '/loc' command was)
	- Added '/goarrow dest' command
	- Changed "Lock HUD position" to "Require Ctrl key to move HUD"
	- Installer includes debug symbols, so stack traces will have line numbers
	- Details tab loads last location's details on startup
	- Find next-longer route
	- Reorganized UI
	- Added Dereth Map
	- Added Dungeon Map
	- Moved arrow images into .zip file
	- Improved the Recent Coordinates list
	- Automatically adds your corpse coords to the Recent Coordinates list when 
		you die, and sets the arrow to point to your corpse.
	- You can now use ACSpedia as a source for the locations database. Changing
		database types will erase your favorite, customized, and recent 
		locations.
	- Relative coords are gold
	- Paths in ArrowHud (click < and > to advance path)
