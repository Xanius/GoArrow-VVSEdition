    <loc id="25" name="Al-Arqas" type="Town" NS="-31.1" EW="13.7">Nestled in deep in the desert lies a small oasis surrounding a natural spring geyser.  This sheltered and green valley in the heart of desolation if Al-Arqas. The tranquility of its isolation and sparse population make it an ideal place to get your bearings in Dereth. Its almost as if a fair angel watches over this small town. - Jacinth the Loremaster

While sparse, if you've been traveling through the featureless desert for days on end, Al-Arqas is a hub of bustling activity. Its welcoming geyser feeding the green of the valley truly makes this an oasis of civilization.

This community is a perfect rest stop for travelers moving through the desert. You can reequip, sell your excess goods to the many merchants, or simply rest your feet. Its obvious even the people of the Empyrean Empire thought the place was special. The presence of several stone guardians around the geyser is proof enough of this.

The dunes surrounding Al-Arqas are filled with various camps of drudges and the occasional shreth.  But one should still travel carefully.  Not to far away lie areas occupied by more dangerous creatures including the undead. If you get lost, you may also be lucky enough to stumble across the tents of people like the wandering archmage (34.3S, 14.4E) where you can briefly rest and recoup.  If you're lucky they may even be willing to trade with you for the items you seek.</loc>

    <loc id="41" name="Under Cove Crypt" type="Dungeon" NS="-21.6" EW="-4.1" dungeonId="343">Once part of a great Empyrean shipping port that operated out of the cove, now all that remains are ruins. The entrance to this dungeon is guarded by a strange set of iron doors. However these doors cannot be opened by a simple key, search nearby to find the answer.

Once inside be prepared to fight skeletons, zombies, and undead as you wander the various levels of this dungeon. You may want to have a skilled vagabond in your party to aid in picking the many locks you'll encounter.

Also be on the lookout for any strange keys you may encounter and be wary. Some adventurers have returned with tales of the earth itself rising up, assuming humanoid form, and attacking whoever invades these tunnels.

This dungeon is great for 1-3 level 5 characters but anyone over level 10 will find little challenge here by themselves.

A map is available. Thank you, GreenEyes.

After his disappearance in the desert wilds several years later, the townsfolk of Samsur erected a fountain to commemorate their missing leader. 

Samsur was built in a small, sheltered valley. The bluffs surrounding it help protect it from the harsh winds and with the abundant water provided by the underground river that feeds the fountain, the area is always lush and green.

    <loc id="139" name="Nanto" type="Town" NS="-52.6" EW="81.9">Nanto has but a few shops that offer the basic necessities for travelers heading south to Mayoi, west to Lin or north to other Sho towns. Along with a collector that specializes in the odd items, there is a Rat Killer that will purchase any rat tails, with a fondness for the rarer grey rat tails.

West from Nanto is a beautiful set of waterfalls with a portal to Yanshi and a lifestone a little further west along the road. Deep within the mountain is a Water Temple that holds a special bottle of water. You will need to make your way through many drudges to find the bottle near a refreshing fountain.

Traveling near the road is advisable, for the hills surrounding Nanto are infested with packs of Drudges, Shreths, Wasps and other hideous creatures.

The Northern Outpost of Nanto, nestled within a small wooded area provides a great resting spot for those that are traveling to or from the northern cities.

Nanto's Eastern Outpost is just a short distance from the sea and the ocean breezes.  Inuo KunKou the Enchanter had his book stolen by the drudges that hide within the candle lit dungeon overlooking the shoreline east of the outpost.</loc>

    <loc id="158" name="Baishi" type="Town" NS="-49.5" EW="62.5">Nestled in a wooded pass in the eastern portion of the Linvak Range, you'll find the quiet town of Baishi. An ideal place for meditation and relaxation. Provided that is that you don't mind the Banderlings, Drudges, and Mosswarts that occupy the surrounding areas. - Jacinth the Loremaster

 Baishi's earliest beginnings can be seen in the merchant compound nearby. The compound was built at the foot of an old Empyrean tower (which doubled as a watchtower) to watch over the mountain pass from Shoushi to Qalaba'r. As time passed, a safer route was found through the mountains from Nanto, through Lin and eventually to Qalaba'r. As a result, Baishi's focus changed from commerce to mining and logging.

The woods around Baishi provide abundant resources if you can guard yourself from the many Drudges, Banderlings, and Mosswarts that seem to continually infest the pass. The merchants and craftsmen here manage to supply the basic needs and then some. There are still a few of the old merchants that retain the skills that were so valuable to them in those days as well as the odd collector or two who still desire to fill their need for that missing item, including a collector specializing in wasp wings.</loc>
    <loc id="159" name="Banderling Tower" type="Landmark" NS="9.3" EW="63.9">This tower is not only occupied by Banderlings but the nearby hills are filled with all kinds of dangerous creatures, from wasps and shreths, to more banderlings.</loc>

I am a humble scholar from Zaikhal. Of late, we have heard of the unusually large number of Drudges in the hills around the Yaraq Cove. They seem to gather near the ruin of the Empyrean port on the far side of the cove, where the Mad Star flickers. Perhaps you could investigate, and bring me back something which would explain their presence?</loc>

    <loc id="608" name="Suntik Village" type="Landmark" NS="16.2" EW="4.4">To get to the village you have to go right around the mountain ridge on the North side, there you'll find a couple of posts showing the way up. In and around the village there are a lot of Crude Monougas, maybe 10-15 altogether, and a few Outcasts as well as the complementary drudge posse. Other than the Crude Monougas there isn't really anything that dangerous up here. A melee character of level 13+ should be able to solo it up here easily enough so long as you're careful not to get surrounded, the Crude Monougas have a pretty fast run too. Many of the Monougas are actually inside the buildings and on the roof and they seem to have the decency to stay there rather than jump down and swarm you so it's easy enough to pick your fights. Not really much in the way of loot though we were there for a couple of hours and picked up a couple of Acid Axes.

One theory is that some faction of the Aluvians built the structure. However they discovered to their dismay that it was built atop some ancient Empyrean ruins. Shortly after it reached its current stage of construction undead began to appear in the fortress` cellars and harrass the trespassers, eventually driving them out.

At some point after that, a tribe of banderlings took up residence, thus making this one of the few locations where a banderling chief can be found. It`s assumed that while the zombies found here harass the banderling ravers, breeders, and raiders within and scouts and guards without, the banderlings pay them no mind, being content to just leave the cellars of the fort to the undead.</loc>

    <loc id="624" name="Wai Jhou" type="Town" NS="-61.8" EW="-51.3">The Direlands town of Wai Jhou is little more than a single building wedged between the Black Hills and a rotting swamp.  The area is filled with terrible creatures, the most fearsome of which are Virindi, tuskers, golems, and gromnies.  The small building houses three shopkeepers, but beware, in this remote outpost prices are very high.  All three women are followers of Jojii and are placid and welcoming despite their awful surroundings.

Ximi Nu, the weaponsmith sells a basic assortment of amour and weapons as befits her Sho heritage, as well as whatever odd rag-tag pieces that passing adventurers might sell to her.  Be on your guard, though, as hapless customers are all too frequently attacked by creatures as they attempt to do their trading.

The healer, Kan Chi Gai, keeps a small counter here selling basic healing services and a few potions and healing supplies.  Her kind words of support and warning will help heal the soul as well.

Dou Ran the mage is an odd zealot selling a limited supply of spell components and alchemical items.  She will speak quixotically of the Disaster Maze which lies to the east of town, but one is left with the impression that she has been isolated in this remote wilderness for too long.  She does, however, sell scrolls of lifestone recall, claiming to have learned the secrets of the spell while within the maze.

The dungeon consists of three levels. The upper level is occupied mainly by creeper mosswarts and mosswart feeders. There is the occasional trap to be ready for, but beyond that, little to challenge an experienced warrior.

The second level of this dungeon is riddled with traps. Fortunately it's simply a set of passages leading to the 3rd level. Just be ready to stop and rest if the acid, lighting, and other traps catch you unaware.

The mosswart nest is on the final level. You'll encounter multiple creeper mosswarts as well as various Barker mosswarts. if you can get past these defends, you'll find the heart of the dungeon. A strange sarcophagus that contains unknown treasures. Be careful though, it too is likely to be trapped.

Exits from this dungeon can be found just west of the entrance chamber as well as on the 3rd level near the Mosswart nest.

Inside this dungeon, you will now find some Banderling Berserkers as well as some Hollow Minions, in addition to the original inhabitants.

This winding dungeon is filled with twists and turns and the architecture marks it distinctly as being a late Empyrean Structure. Located beside one of the mysterious Empyrean sentinel statues, just a bit north of Holtburg's western outpost, this dungeon provides challenges to those adventurers looking to challenge their abilities after braving the dangers found closer to Holtburg.

This dungeon contains a mix of the lesser members of the banderling tribes. Here you'll find Banderling Scouts,  Young,  Guards, and the occasional  Raider. A group of 3-4 level 5 characters might find it difficult to clear this dungeon and even a pair of level 10's might find difficulty here. However the spawns are spread out to provide you with plenty of opportunity to rest and recover between battles.

The local townsfolk don't talk about the Barracks much and exploration has revealed that it may have been the scene of much bloodshed.

Recently Breeanna was kind enough to explore the dungeon for us and found a mixture of various Drudges there. Skulkers, Slinkers, and Sneakers all now call this dreary place home. They cluster together in groups of 2-4 and haunt the halls, living amoung the refuse left by the late human inhabitants.

Its obvious by the furnishing that this location was abandoned in a hurry. Maybe someday it will be reclaimed. Until then it remains a tomb. A single adventurer of level 5-10 will have little difficulty with this location. The fact that the drudges stay is seperated packs makes this is dungeon ideal for any sized group of low level characters to explore. Just becareful you don't accidently find yourself in the middle of a pack of 4 or so Slinkers.

During their flight they discovered a portal to an archipelago to the southeast of what is now present day Mayoi.  A man named Zenzaburou Hensu founded the town on the basis of Sho religious tenants, which some of the less "upright" refugees resented.  These few left to found their own town, but the community of Kryst thrived in a land far less dangerous than their fellows' chosen location.

The principles that Zenzaburou wished to form a new township were not to MacNiall and his crew's liking though and thus they travelled into the more dangerous wilds of the archipelago and founded MacNiall's Freehold.  The town remained isolated from the rest of Dereth until Leafcull, PY 11 (Should the Stars Fall) when new portals opened access to the archipelago once more.</loc>

    <loc id="1580" name="Britana" type="NPC" NS="69.6" EW="-62.6">In the fall of 2005, Viamontians raided Marae Lassal, capturing some of its townsfolk. Britana is now imprisoned in the Viamontian Torture Chamber at 69.6N 62.6W. 
Britana tells you, "What? Who's there? Ketnan? Mazur? Please, get me out of here!"

Britana tells you, "Greetings brave adventurer!  My name is Britana, perhaps you've heard of my...never mind, he isn't important anyway.  What is important is have I got a deal for you!  Perhaps you have heard of a small fashion accessory...The Hoary Mattekar Robe?  Yes, I am sure you have.  Well, unlike some others who seek to perpetuate fraud upon the Isparian public with cheap knockoffs, Britana only provides the real thing."

Britana tells you, "I have come to this island upon hearing reports of a great white beast that stalks its northern coasts.  Rumor has it this is a Mattekar straight out of legend, come to rid the island of its troublesome denizens.  Which denizens, you ask?  Legend does not say."

Britana tells you, "But what I say is that a Mattekar this large and strong must produce a robe which makes the Hoary robe seem like a bath rug!  Bring me this mattekar pelt, and I will craft you a robe fit for a king!"</loc>
    <loc id="1581" name="Mazur ibn Stounis" type="NPC" NS="42.9" EW="-66.7">Mazur ibn Stounis tells you, "Yes, I have agreed to help Britana in her quest to fashion a new Hoary Mattekar Robe.  I don't know where this new Mattekar is rumored to be, you would have to ask Britana.  I have to admit, I had never encountered a woman like Britana before back in my home village.  She is quite the woman."

After September 2005
Mazur ibn Stounis tells you, "Have you any word of Britana? I can barely sleep at night, my heart is sick with worry for her. Varicci's men dragged her off solely because of her brother! And now I am told I must aid this Eliza woman or share Britana's fate! I tell myself that I can do Britana no good imprisoned, but... at any rate, I will still aid you in the crafting of robes."</loc>

    <loc id="1587" name="Aun Papileona" type="NPC" NS="39.8" EW="-76.4">Aun Papileona tells you, "Greetings, traveler. I have a grave favor to ask you. In his jealousy, the anima Carenzi has infested the beautiful shrine I built for Raeta with his creatures. I tried to route them myself, but the horrid beasts nearly ripped me to pieces and ate the key to my chest! Until my shrine is cleansed of his defiling presence, Raeta will not return!"

Aun Papileona tells you, "I locked my amulet inside my chest--if you bring it to me as proof that you have driven Carenzi away, I will reward you with the title of Carenzi Slayer. Follow Volkama's riverbanks to the north, and you'll find my shrine."

(Starting point for the Raeta's Necklace quest.)</loc>
    <loc id="1588" name="Aun Whethura the Crafter" type="NPC" NS="43.9" EW="-78.1">Aun Whethura the Crafter tells you, "How I miss the birds of my home world! My brother Ihipura once taught me to invoke their animas for aid. If you bring me a small bundle of feathers from the Kithless Siraluun that roam the island, I will ask Siraluun to help me make a special headdress for you. Even better, if you combine the five of the smaller bundles into a large one, I will make a lovely dress. Here, add the bundles to this special bag, it will keep them from getting rumpled."

Aun Whethura the Crafter gives you Emproidered Bag.

The Emboidered Bag will allow you to safely store Small Bundles of Kithless Siraluun Feathers to be crafted into a fine Siraluun Dress.  He also takes single bundles to craft a Siraluun Headress. (See our writeup.)</loc>
    <loc id="1589" name="Bachus Flufens" type="NPC" NS="43.6" EW="-85.4">Bachus Flufens tells you, "A visitor! I do not often get many visitors to my modest homestead. Did Micon or Lark tell you that I've been spending time with the Tumeroks? A most fanciful folk, I must say! Why, just the other day one of the Hea told me about a legendary spear they dismantled and enshrined in two separate parts of the island. It once belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to have some sort of magical, "living" properties to it. I'm not quite sure what to believe."

Bachus Flufens tells you, "Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest along the shore.  Try the area around 44 North, 87 West--at least that's where I saw my new Tumerok acquaintences heading last. Beware, friend--it sounded as if they held this artifact in high esteem, and it's quite likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must catch up on my journal today. If you would like to read it, here are a few pages that I wrote the other day."

Bachus Flufens gives you Bachus Flufen's Journal.

After September 2005
Bachus Flufens tells you, "Woe is me! As if it were not bad enough that I was driven out of my farm to the west by the Hea, now Varicci has taken over my town! Fortunately Micon and I are safe, but I must say that it has made it very difficult to continue my work."</loc>

I was busy exploring a wonderfully well-preserved abandoned Tumerok outpost, when I was beset upon by a number of Olthoi!"

Behdo Yii tells you, "I had never seen these fearsome creatures that close before, and the fact that I escaped with my life leads me to believe that these Olthoi aren't quite so tough as their mainland counterparts.  If you could journey to this tumerok outpost and rid it of these troublesome beasts I would be most grateful."

Traveler. I have a tale to tell and a task I would put upon you. Were you to take this task on yourself, you will bear witness to things I have seen and a wondrous device I glimpsed but could not fathom or grasp. 

For you see, there is an artifact in a place unlike any that exists in Dereth. 

I am an explorer for the Explorer Society. In a desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a cliff. The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was lost in the spinning light of a portal. I held my breath and stepped upon teh walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far below. Yet, the walkway held my weight! I crept forward and stepped through the portal. I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow extended through the portal. There was a platform at its far end, then another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself. Suffice it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air above it. I would know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, I believe, of small consequence! Before I was able to reach it, a wretched monster send me back to my Lifestone! Later, I attempted to return, yet the portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why. 

I must study this device. I call it the "Arcane Pedestal." I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but first I require an imprint of its morphology. 

I shall give you a copy of my notes and Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device. Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study it and determine how to create it. 

The Aracane Pedestal! We shall have the Arcane Pedestal!</loc>

    <loc id="2251" name="Verdentine Magnan" type="NPC" NS="75.8" EW="-20.3">Verdentine Magnan tells you...

I am afraid I find the recent Grievver activity in this valley somewhat unsettling. They seem to guard the area against all other creatures. Ive never seen Grievvers build a nest, but I think thats just what they are doing. Perhaps the lack of Shadow infulence for so long is allowing them to return to a more natural existence. If you think yourself brave enough I would be very grateful to know what they are doing in the far east of the valley. 

I am very interested in insect trophies and body parts. You can learn much about a creature from its remains. If you have any I would greatly enjoy looking them over. Dont worry Ill return them after Ive examined them. I do however have a powerful appetite and cannot make the same assurances about food. Haha! 

This I know for a fact. The Grievvers cannot abide the presence of Olthoi. They will fight fiercely against them whenever the two come in contact. This leads me to believe that the Grievvers and Olthoi share some common origin. 

Did you see that? A little Grievver! I wonder if its a different species or just a juvenile. 

I believe that the Grievvers have a complex social order. I can often see one deferring to another in combat or during feeding. Yet it doesnt appear to be a purely physical hierarchy since Ive seen a smaller Grievver receive deferential treatment. Perhaps they also recognize intelligence or magical ability as dominating traits. Its all very interesting! 

No, I cant have a campfire. It might attract the Grievvers. Small price to pay really.</loc>

It is said that Mage Syltyn Rillon is very interested in this artifact. If you can find it in this dungeon and its maze of portals, perhaps she will reward you.</loc>
    <loc id="2449" name="Mage Syltyn Rillon" type="NPC" NS="27.8" EW="24.7">This mage, located just outside of Glendon Wood, seems to know a great deal about the frozen sword in the dias located within the town proper. Perhaps she will give you clues as to its origin and how to free it from its chilly home.

Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, "Hello. I am Mage Syltyn Rillon, a member of the Explorer Society. Perhaps you are wondering about the sword on the dais in town. I had been a friend of Martine's back on Ispar.  I encountered Martine here, during one of his mad rampages. He knew not who I was, nor did he seem to care and the encounter ended badly for me. Upon arriving at the Lifestone I was angry, yet understood that the Virindi were principally at fault for causing Martine's actions. I became determined to help fellow Isparians combat the Virindi and other perils of this harsh land. With the help of Omaro Nagate the weaponsmith, I crafted a frost sword that should be of good utility to adventurers who are skilled in the ways of the blade."
Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, "To obtain this weapon you must first prove your worthiness. There is a Virindi complex north of Bandit Road. I left a note on a tree along Bandit Road, east of Neydisa Castle, marking the location where you should turn north. Go to the complex, navigate through it and bring to me a Virindi Signet. I shall then allow you to take the sword."
Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, "Oh, take this.  It will aid you in your journey through part of the complex. Read it carefully."
Mage Syltyn Rillon gives you A Tale of Paths.</loc>
